<h2 id="frequentlyaskedquestions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Is the template responsive?</strong> Absolutely.</p>

<p><strong>How do I customize the template?</strong> You will need to know your way around Sass to customize Spark to be on brand. In most cases, you will simply want to change the color values located in the <code>_variables.scss</code> file in the <code>sass/utils</code> directory. In other cases, you may want to customize the typography, layout, etc. Do not attempt the latter unless you know what you are doing.</p>

<p><strong>Are there know limitations?</strong> Yes. The page has been optimized for the exact amount of copy you see in the <a href="http://spark.heavyheavy.com">demo</a>. If you require more content, you will need to get your hands dirty customizing the code to fit your needs.</p>

<p><strong>Are there image sizes I need to be aware of?</strong> Yes. All of the image file names in the <code>assets/images</code> directory are appended with their respective dimensions. These should be considered rules and not recommendations unless you are prepared to perform customizations where needed.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use this for a client project?</strong>
Yes. It would be nice to receive credit, though.</p>
